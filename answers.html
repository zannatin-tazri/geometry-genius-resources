        <h3>1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM? </h3>
    <p class="p-5">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and XML(Extensible
        markup language) documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and
        manipulated.
        <br>
        Using DOM, the JavaScript gets access to HTML as well as CSS of the web page and can also add behavior to the
            HTML elements. so basically Document Object Model is an API that represents and interacts with HTML or XML
            documents.</p>
    
    <h3>2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM method.</h3>
    <p class="p-5">There are 5 ways in which I can select elements in a DOM using selectors-
        a) getElementsByTagName() <br>
        b) getElementsByClassName() <br>
        c) getElementById() <br>
        d) querySelector() <br>
        e) querySelectorAll()</p>
    <h3>3. What is event bubble?</h3>
    <p class="p-5">Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event, and
        that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the
        DOM tree until it gets to the root element. <br>
    This is the default behavior of events on elements unless you stop the propagation.</p>
    <h3>4. What is a callback function and why will you see it?</h3>
    <p class="p-5">A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is expected to be called
        back at a later point in time. <br> The function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a
        higher-order function.
